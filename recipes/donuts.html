    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These Easy Lemon Cheesecake Crème Brulée "Donuts" offer a delightful twist on a classic dessert, combining the creamy richness of cheesecake with the tangy brightness of lemon and the irresistible crunch of caramelized sugar. Made with just five ingredients, including sweet Hawaiian rolls, cheesecake filling, and lemon curd, these treats come together quickly yet taste impressively sophisticated. After being lightly toasted, the rolls are filled with a luscious lemon cheesecake mixture, then topped with a golden sugar crust that hardens to give that signature crème brûlée crackle. Finished with a sprinkle of fresh lemon zest, these "donuts" are a perfect blend of buttery, tangy, and sweet, making them an easy yet indulgent dessert that's sure to impress.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls, such as Kings Original Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, separated</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cheesecake filling, such as Philadelphia® Cheesecake No Bake Filling</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon curd</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish or rimmed baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Brush each roll with melted butter and place in the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine cheesecake filling, lemon curd, and 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a bowl and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add mixture to a piping bag or large resealable plastic bag. Make a small cut in one corner of the bag.</li>
        <li>Use a paring knife to make a small cut into the side of each roll, creating an opening large enough to pipe the filling into without going all the way through. Fill each roll with about 1 1/2 tablespoons filling and return to the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and water to a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, without stirring, until lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes; remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment, and set a rack over the sheet. Working very carefully, dip the top of each roll into sugar mixture and place it right side up on the rack.</li>
        <li>Grate remaining lemon zest over rolls. Let stand until completely cooled and lightly hardened on top, 10 to 15 minutes. If sugar mixture becomes too thick before all rolls are coated, return the pot to low heat and swirl it lightly until it melts again.</li>
    </ol>
